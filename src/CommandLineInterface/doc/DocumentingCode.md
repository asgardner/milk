## Github documentation

File README.md is the front page for documentation on the github site. It includes a link to `./index.md` which is the top menu for the documentation, from which all documentation should be accessible.


## Doxygen input files

Documentation is generated by doxygen from multiple sources:

- pages.dox top-level menu, which is the main page for doxygen-generated documentation. Contains entries such as `@subpage page_pagename` or `@ref page_pagename` that point to corresponding `{#page_installation}` tags in any of the `doc/xxx.md` files.
- markdown files (<filename>.md) in doc/ directories
- documentation contained in source code (.c and .h files)




## Other documentation

Additional documentation that is not meant to be processed by doxygen (but can be linked from it) should be placed in directories named docdir. This can consist of pdf files, markdown file, or any other format.
