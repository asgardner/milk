# Network information:
#
# 1. LN - Lab Network.
# Within the second floor lab at Steward, there exists a network
# segment reserved for MAPS that is approximately 10.130.149.0/24.
# Accessing this network requires being connected to the Cisco VPN
# at https://vpn.arizona.edu/mmt-split or /mmt-full.
#
# 2. MUN - Mountain Unrouteable Network, aka "the rack network" or "the topbox network".
# At the MMT, there is also a network segment for 10.130.149.0/24. This network 
# is not routeable, and thus inaccessible unless you are physically at the MMT
# or use a computer that has an interface on a public, routeable network AND 
# a connection to the MAPS network segment. There is physical connection between
# the rack and the control room and a switch in the control room that you can 
# connect to that will give you access to this network. There is no DHCP on this
# network, so you should choose an address that doesn't conflict with others.
#
# 3. MRN - Mountain Routeable Network, aka "the building network".
# At the MMT, there is also a public, routeable network. IP addresses on this
# network are available globally without a VPN. IP addresses on this network
# are in 128.196.100.0/24 and may offer a bridge between the outside world and
# the MUN (see section 2).

# IP addresses that work in the lab with the VPN and in the 
# unrouteable network on the mountain.
